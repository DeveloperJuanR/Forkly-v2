# MVVM Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the changes made to refactor the Forkly app to better conform to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

## 1. API Service Improvements

### RecipeAPIService
- Added a dedicated `RecipeAPIError` enum for consistent error handling
- Refactored all API methods to use Result type with the custom error enum
- Made error handling consistent across all API methods
- Improved code organization with better MARK comments
- Consolidated URL constants for better maintainability

## 2. ViewModels Enhancements

### Created New ViewModel
- Added `RecipeDetailViewModel` to handle recipe detail loading and processing
- Moved data processing logic from views to the appropriate ViewModels

### Improved Existing ViewModels
- Updated `RecipeSearchViewModel` to use the improved API service
- Updated `FeaturedRecipesViewModel` to use the improved API service
- Enhanced `FavoritesManager` with better state management and async operations
- Added Combine framework support for future reactive programming capabilities

## 3. Code Organization

### Created Utilities Directory
- Moved string extension methods to a dedicated `StringUtilities.swift` file
- Separated concerns by moving helper methods out of view files

## 4. Dependency Injection

### App-Level DI
- Added proper environment object injection in the main app file
- Ensured consistent access to shared services across the app

## 5. View Refactoring

### RecipeDetailLoaderView
- Replaced direct API calls with ViewModel usage
- Simplified the view by delegating data loading to the ViewModel

### RecipeDetailView
- Removed string extension methods in favor of the dedicated utilities file
- Simplified the view to focus on presentation rather than data processing

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data, business logic, and UI
2. **Testability**: ViewModels can now be tested independently of the UI
3. **Maintainability**: Code is more organized and follows consistent patterns
4. **Scalability**: Easier to add new features or modify existing ones
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent approach to error handling throughout the app

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for ViewModels
2. Consider implementing more reactive patterns using Combine
3. Further refine the Models to better represent the domain
